> Mini 0xSplitz Implementation

This was an upgrade compared to my tip-distribution contract. As a mini-implementation of 0xSplitz, the Dapp can form groups of addresses (splits). After a group is formed, anyone can send funds to the newly formed group and when received, funds are split among the designated recipients automatically. The owner or admin can add and remove as many recipients as necessary.

This project was done in participation of the Canto Monthly Hackathon. Although I didn't finish on time, it was a great learning experience!
